        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Preheat Oven:</strong> Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C).</li>
            <li><strong>Cook the Meat Sauce:</strong> In a large skillet, heat olive oil over medium heat.
                Add chopped onions and minced garlic, sauté until softened. Add ground beef and cook until browned.
                Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, tomato sauce, basil, oregano, salt, and pepper. Simmer for
                15-20 minutes, stirring occasionally.</li>
            <li><strong>Prepare the Cheese Mixture:</strong> In a bowl, mix ricotta cheese, 1 cup mozzarella
                cheese, Parmesan cheese, egg, and chopped parsley until well combined.</li>
            <li><strong>Assemble the Lasagna:</strong> In a baking dish, spread a thin layer of the meat sauce.
                Place a layer of cooked lasagna noodles on top. Add half of the cheese mixture, spreading it
                evenly. Repeat the layers, finishing with a layer of meat sauce on top.</li>
            <li><strong>Bake:</strong> Cover the baking dish with foil and bake in the preheated oven for 25
                minutes. Remove the foil and sprinkle the remaining mozzarella cheese on top. Bake for an
                additional 10-15 minutes or until the cheese is bubbly and golden.</li>
            <li><strong>Serve:</strong> Allow the lasagna to cool for a few minutes before slicing. Garnish with
                fresh basil leaves if desired.</li>
