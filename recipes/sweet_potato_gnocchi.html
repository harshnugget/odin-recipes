            <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>2 medium-sized sweet potatoes, baked and mashed</li>
                <li>2 cups all-purpose flour, plus extra for dusting</li>
                <li>1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
                <li>1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg</li>
                <li>1 large egg, beaten</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Bake Sweet Potatoes:</strong> Preheat the oven to 400°F (200°C). Bake the sweet
                    potatoes until tender. Once cooled, peel and mash them.</li>
                <li><strong>Prepare Dough:</strong> In a large mixing bowl, combine the mashed sweet potatoes,
                    flour, Parmesan cheese, salt, nutmeg, and beaten egg. Mix until a soft dough forms.</li>
                <li><strong>Knead and Shape:</strong> Turn the dough out onto a floured surface. Knead it gently,
                    adding more flour if needed to prevent sticking. Divide the dough into smaller portions and
                    roll each into a long rope.</li>
                <li><strong>Cut into Gnocchi:</strong> Cut the ropes into bite-sized pieces. Optionally, use a fork
                    to create ridges on the gnocchi.</li>
                <li><strong>Cook Gnocchi:</strong> Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Drop the gnocchi
                    into the boiling water and cook until they float to the surface, indicating they are done.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Optional Sauté:</strong> For added flavor, sauté the cooked gnocchi in a pan with
                    butter or olive oil until they develop a golden crust.</li>
                <li><strong>Serve:</strong> Plate the sweet potato gnocchi and serve with your favorite sauce,
                    such as brown butter and sage or a light tomato sauce. Garnish with additional Parmesan
                    cheese if desired.</li>
            </ol>
