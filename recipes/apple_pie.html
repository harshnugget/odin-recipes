        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>6 cups peeled, cored, and sliced apples (such as Granny Smith)</li>
            <li>3/4 cup granulated sugar</li>
            <li>1/4 cup packed brown sugar</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon lemon juice</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1 package (14 ounces) refrigerated pie crusts (or homemade)</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon butter, cut into small pieces</li>
            <li>1 egg, beaten (for egg wash)</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon granulated sugar (for sprinkling)</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>                
            <li><strong>Preheat Oven:</strong> Preheat your oven to 425°F (220°C).</li>
            <li><strong>Prepare Apples:</strong> In a large bowl, combine sliced apples, granulated sugar, brown
                sugar, cinnamon, nutmeg, lemon juice, and flour. Toss until the apples are evenly coated.</li>
            <li><strong>Roll Out Pie Crust:</strong> Roll out one pie crust and place it in a 9-inch pie dish. Trim
                the excess crust from the edges.</li>
            <li><strong>Add Apple Filling:</strong> Pour the apple mixture into the pie crust, spreading it
                evenly. Dot the top with small pieces of butter.</li>
            <li><strong>Top with Second Crust:</strong> Roll out the second pie crust and place it over the apple
                filling. Trim and crimp the edges to seal the pie. Cut a few slits on the top crust to allow
                steam to escape.</li>
            <li><strong>Brush with Egg Wash:</strong> Brush the top crust with the beaten egg and sprinkle with
                granulated sugar.</li>
            <li><strong>Bake:</strong> Bake in the preheated oven for 45-50 minutes or until the crust is
                golden brown and the filling is bubbly. If the edges start to brown too quickly, you can
                cover them with foil.</li>
            <li><strong>Cool and Serve:</strong> Allow the apple pie to cool for at least 2 hours before
                serving. Serve it with a scoop of vanilla ice cream if desired.</li>
        </ol>
